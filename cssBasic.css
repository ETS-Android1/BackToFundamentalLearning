//Welcome to CSS!

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

- Cascading refers to the way CSS applies one style on top of another.
- Style Sheets control the look and feel of web documents.

CSS and HTML work hand in hand:
- HTML sorts out the page structure.
- CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed.

Why Use CSS?

CSS allows you to apply specific styles to specific HTML elements.

The main benefit of CSS is that it allows you to separate style from content. 

Using just HTML, all the styles and formatting are in the same place, which becomes rather difficult to maintain as the page grows.
All formatting can (and should) be removed from the HTML document and stored in a separate CSS file.

//inline styling

<p style = "color:white; background-color:gray;">
	This is an example of inline styling.
</p>


//Embedded / Internal CSS

Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the head section of an HTML page.

<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			p{
				color:white;
				background-color:gray;
			}
		</style>
	</head>

	<body>
		<p> This is my first paragraph. </p>
		<p> This is my second paragraph. </p>
	</body>
</html>

// External CSS

The HTML:
<head>
	<link rel = "stylesheet" href="example.css"
</head>
<body>
	<p> This is my first paragraph </p>
	<p> This is my second paragraph </p>
	<p> This is my third paragraph </p>
</body>

The CSS:
p {
	color:white;
	background-color:gray;
}
