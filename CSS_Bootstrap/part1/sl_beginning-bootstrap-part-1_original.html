	<div> Hello World!</div>
	<div> This is page before CSS bootstrap! </div>
	<div> This is page after CSS bootstrap! Let's go to <a href="sl_beginning-bootstrap-part-1.html"> after </a> page :) </div>
	<div> You're learning Bootstrap 3.3.7 on Geeksforgeeks.org </div>
	<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/"> getbootstrap.com documentation </a>
	<div><h3> Method A </h3></div>
	<p> This method of installing Bootstrap is fairly easy but it requires Internet connection. </p>
	<p> It is highly recommended that you follow this method. </p>
	<p> 1. Goto www.getbootstrap.com and click Getting Started . Scroll down. </p>
	<p> 2. Copy the first two paragraphs and paste it in the head section of the html code.</p>
	<p> 3. Copy the 3rd paragraph from the website and paste it just before the ending the body section of the html code.</p>
	<p> 4. This is the last step. We need to download the latest jQuery version and copy the link in the body section. Here, I have the link which need to write before the bootstrap.min.js script.</p>
	<p> 5. Bingo! Youâ€™ve installed Bootstrap on your html document. To see the changes on your document, try opening the page on a seperate tab of your browser and you can easily notice the difference between the two codes. Though, not much of difference can be felt till now, but it would be apparent in the later parts of the article. Here, the one on the left is without bootstrap and the one on the right is with bootstrap installed.</p>
